NOTES ON USE:

When extracting your outlines, using a question mark ? as your delimiter is required.

The VBA recognizes the question mark as the delimiter for the outlines files.

If you want to use a different delimiter, you will have to modify the VBA code.

Extract the two cubes' outlines to separate folders.
